* To-do items
** TODO Resolve items marked as =TODO=
** TODO =XpathFinder.next=: don't always call =getAt_=

** TODO =Main.add=: do not save every single highlight id
There is currently no need to save every single highlight id in the =sets= array since individual query set highlights will never be removed.  If they're never removed, then one can assume that highlight ids within a particular query set are contiguous, with the only attribute needed to be saved being the *start* highlight id.

** TODO =Range.computeXpath=: looking for index of =Css.highlight=
This is potentially problematic if the document uses class names that contain or are equal to =Css.highlight=.

** DONE Document new classes and code improvements
- State "DONE"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2015-04-02 Thu 12:26]
- State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2015-04-02 Thu 07:58]
Class =XPathFinder= and methods =nthOf_=, =elementAt=, =xpathOf=.

** DONE Employ binary search algorithm
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-03-30 Mon 14:20]
Employ binary search algorithm to look up offset.

** DONE =remove=: not recalculating the current query status
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-03-30 Mon 14:20]
** CANCELED =remove=: must update the `highlight-*Â´ class of all items
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2015-03-30 Mon 14:20] \\
  Not necessary anymore.
